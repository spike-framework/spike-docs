            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
                Spike Framework in general was build to handle <span class="important-word blue red">cordova</span> mobile applications with <span class="important-word blue">lightweight and extendable structure</span>
                <br/>
                written in <span class="important-word blue">plain JavaScript</span> and with support <span class="important-word blue">jQuery usage</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Applications had to <span class="important-word blue">run on old devices as well as on new ones</span>, so I decided to avoid any kind of modern frameworks as Angular or Ionic with Angular modified core,
                <br/>
                Knockout, React, Reactive etc. because very often those <span class="important-word blue">frameworks generated more problems</span>, than they resolved.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also the problem with modern and big frameworks is <span class="important-word blue">enormous documentation</span> (mainly for Angular and Ionic) which can take big percentage of application development process
                <br/>
                to learn and study framework details.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another topic is <span class="important-word blue">TypeScript usage</span>, which I think is nice feature but in general it also <span class="important-word blue">create more problems</span> such as longer project build time, only shallow OOP usage because of
                <br/>
                dependencies, which in most cases are not typed and even they are typed, it <span class="important-word blue">takes long time to learn</span> tens of new classes and interfaces.
                <br/>
                In general, using <span class="important-word blue">TypeScript slows down development process</span> and for me - <span class="important-word blue">takes away enjoyment of coding in JavaScript</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                Spike Framework after almost two years of internal use in some companies was <span class="important-word blue">released in 2017</span> (resources was always open-source and available since 2016).

            <h4>Short summary</h4>
            <p>
                Spike Framework is an Model-View-Controller architecture framework, where <span class="important-word blue">View</span> is realized by HTML templates,
                <br/>
                <span class="important-word blue">Controller</span> is realized by components, controllers or partials, and
                <br/>
                <span class="important-word blue">Model</span> is realized by local database model and controller, component and partials data.
                <br/>
                Spike Framework includes such a features like automatic jQuery selectors, imports, template engine, GStrings, routing, translations manager, debugging,
                <br/>
                simple configuration, controllers, modals, components, partials, enums, globals, services, utils, REST providers, REST mocking, interceptors, local SQLLite
                <br/>
                and WebSQL support with by-model definition, database model, database query builder and CRUD, events handling, custom implementations and overrides, screens transitions, wrapping Cordova plugins.
                <br/>
                The main concept is simply and fast web and mobile application development with plain JavaScript and jQuery (no matter which version).
                <br/>
                Spike Framework has only this functionality which is needed and can be done with minimalist impact on performance or code size or complicity.
                <br/>
                Also the concept is to create abstract layer for developer to keep project consistent with minimal effort and to keep biggest freedom in implementation.
                <br/>
                Spike Framework is in opposite to big frameworks as Ionic or Angular, which ones require extensive knowledge.
